# Task2: Creating a simple communication scheme between Microsoft Forms(client) and Arduino(server)

## How to Build the Project

### Building the Server:
1. Download and install the Arduino IDE: [Arduino IDE Getting Started](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/nano/nano-getting-started/)
2. Open the file located at `/Server/arduino_server.ino` using the Arduino IDE.
3. Select the correct COM port for your Arduino board:
   - Go to **Tools** > **Port** and choose the appropriate port from the list.
   - Go to **Tools > Board** and choose the Arduino NANO.
4. Upload the program code to the Arduino board:
   - Click the **Upload** button (right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE. Wait for the upload to complete; you should see a "Done uploading" message in the IDE status bar.
